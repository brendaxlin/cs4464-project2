                  <p><span class="headline hl4">by BRENDA LIN</span></p>
                  
                  <div class = "body-text">
                  <span class="headline hl1">Overview</span>
                  <p>
                    When homeowners are looking to relocate, one of the most commonly asked questions is how is the local school district and how high is the crime in the area. These future residents, particularly new young couples who looking for a place to put down root for their families, often overlook city residents in favor of more suburan locals as they are often tooted and have proven to be more crime-free and have better education. Historically, residents will move away from an area if the crime rate is higher and education falls. As Atlanta becomes more of a economic hub, more are moving into the area and weighing whether living in areas closer to midtown is worth it based on these two factors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With crime data from Atlanta Police Department and educational data of all the high schools in Metro Atlanta schools from the Governor's Office of Student Achievement and Georgia's Department of Education, I mapped out the data to determine whether there was a correlation between the number of crimes in an area and how a school fared academically, particularly at their SAT scores and College and Career Ready Performance Index (CCPRI), which is how the state of Georgia determines whether the students in a area are ready for the next step out of high school. The CCPRI score out of 100. The schools are represented by house icons and the crimes identified by an "X" icon. More information can be found on click about the academic scores. Higher density crimes are identified by red colors while lower density crimes are shown by green. Midrange crime is shown by yellow spots, much like a traffic light. What I found confirm some of the old affirmations that more crime happens closer to the center of the city and that education was lower in the north and south west sections of the city. However, for certain school such as Douglas High School, the crime surrounding the school was lower than in surrounding areas.

                  <span class="headline hl1">Explanation of Variance and Error</span>
                  <p>Lower Education scores is not necessarily the causation of crime. While certain teachers may be deterred from living in more crime-filled areas, it does not imply that teachers will avoid living in the city altogether. Plus, it costs more to live closer to the middle of the city, so certain teachers may avoid higher living costs. Areas in the city are statisically economically poorer than suburban areas, so the better grades may be a result of more help financially. The schools on the map may vary in type, such as charter schools or catering specifically to autistic students.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  For any error in the data may be from schools not reporting accurate information. Additionally, many of the schools with special programs may not report SAT or CCPRI data. Additionally, the data span for crime is not as widespread as that for Metro Atlanta schools.
                  </p>

                  <span class="headline hl1">Moving Foward</span>
                  <p>My next steps in this process would be to identify which areas are increasing in population and determining how seriously new residents are taking in these two factors. In addition to overlaying some census data, I would also contact some new residents of different areas of Atlanta and get some primary accounts of their decisions to move here and whether crime and education was part of their decision to move here. I would also examine the finacial status of each of the areas and see if that is a factor in the success of the school.
